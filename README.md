# Selenium BDD Framework

Welcome to the Selenium BDD Framework repository! This framework is designed to facilitate Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) using Selenium for web automation testing.

## Overview

This Selenium BDD Framework is built to streamline the process of creating and executing automated tests for web applications. By leveraging BDD principles, it encourages collaboration between stakeholders, testers, and developers, ensuring that the tests reflect the desired behavior of the application.

## Features

- **BDD Support**: The framework supports BDD methodologies, allowing you to write tests in a human-readable format using Gherkin syntax.
- **Selenium Integration**: Utilizes Selenium WebDriver for interacting with web elements and performing actions on web pages.
- **Cucumber Integration**: Integrates with Cucumber, a popular BDD tool, enabling the creation of feature files that describe the behavior of the application.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implements the Page Object Model design pattern to enhance test maintenance and readability.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend and customize the framework according to the specific requirements of your project.
- **Reporting**: Generates comprehensive test reports to provide insights into test execution results.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the Selenium BDD Framework, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/umangbhatia786/Selenium-BDD-framework.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You may need to install Java, Maven, and other required dependencies depending on your environment.

3. **Write Feature Files**: Create feature files using Gherkin syntax to describe the behavior of your application.

4. **Implement Step Definitions**: Implement step definitions to define the actions to be performed for each step in your feature files.

5. **Run Tests**: Execute your tests using Maven commands or your preferred testing tool.

6. **Review Reports**: Review the generated test reports to analyze test results and identify any issues.
